# About me
My name is Preetham Ananthkumar, and I'm an enthusiast for all things coding. I have always been fascinated by technology ever since a young age and its potential to bring positive change to the world. With a background in coding over the years, whether it be from high school all the way through university, I strive to leverage my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions that make a difference. I am now currently studying a degree in Cybersecurity.

# My interests
I have a wide range of interests. Here are a few areas that I'm particularly passionate about:

- Software development methodologies: Mainly learning how software teams for large code bases work, so experimented with GitHub actions.
- Cybersecurity: Involves networking, pen testing, malware analysis, and reverse engineering.
- Android App Development: Learning Kotlin as well as more recently, Jetpack Compose.
- iOS App Development: Learning Swift and SwiftUI recently.

# What you'll find here
In my GitHub repositories, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my skills and expertise. Here's a glimpse of what you can explore:

- aaf-internal-notes: Deployed a local JS notes application to the cloud using AWS resources. Automated the whole process using a CI/CD pipeline.
- TunesTogether:  As part of my A-Level Computer Science coursework (NEA), I attempted to develop a collaborative music-listening Android application in Kotlin. This involved developing the UI in XML, the backend logic in Kotlin, and using database services such as Firebase.
- NCCD-CW3: This includes creating a whole network from scratch for a local charity organisation, involving subnetting, segmentation, and zoning as well as implementing NAT and firewall rules between different machines on the network for specific user security privileges.
- Codelabs: Followed through tutorials from the official companies of Android and iOS app development, adding my own changes when necessary.
- Neovim: since my main code editor is Neovim, I've added my editor configuration combined with all necessary plugins.
- React Calendar App: an app to help my dad organise much better via the use of calendars.

Feel free to explore these projects, clone them, and provide feedback. I'm always open to collaboration and learning from the community.

I look forward to hearing from you and exploring new opportunities together!

Cheers,
Preetham Ananthkumar
