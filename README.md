# About me
My name is Preetham Ananthkumar, and I'm an enthusiast for all things coding. I have always been fascinated by technology ever since a young age and its potential to bring positive change to the world. With a background in coding over the years, whether it be from high school all the way through university, I strive to leverage my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions that make a difference. I am now currently studying a degree in Cybersecurity.

# My interests
I have a wide range of interests. Here are a few areas that I'm particularly passionate about:

- Software development methodologies: Mainly learning how software teams for large code bases work, so experimented with GitHub actions.
- Cybersecurity: Involves networking, pen testing, malware analysis, and reverse engineering.
- Android App Development: Learning Kotlin as well as more recently, Jetpack Compose.
- iOS App Development: Learning Swift and SwiftUI recently.

Feel free to explore these projects, clone them, and provide feedback. I'm always open to collaboration and learning from the community.

I look forward to hearing from you and exploring new opportunities together!

Cheers,
Preetham Ananthkumar
